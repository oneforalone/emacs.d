#+TITLE: A Complete Personal Emacs Configuration

In the last couples of years, I've just using Purcell's emacs configuration.
However, I do not get a lot of fun, cause there are so many extends packages
I never used, and I like keep things clean. Therefore, I decided to write a
new configuration for my own.

This configuration will contain *Common Lisp*, *C/C++* and *Org*. One thing should
declare that I perfer *smex* and *ido* more than *helm*.
